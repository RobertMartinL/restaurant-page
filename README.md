Underneath the hero image are 3 large buttons that users can explore other offers, features, promotions, etc.
At the top of the page, the user sees options About Us, Hours and Location, and Menu. The about section serves to describe how the business began and can also include a mission statement. The hours and location section contains the hours and a google maps insert on an element called an iframe, which is used to load third party websites on another website. The menu section is a full food menu organized into cards, each menu item containing an image, title of dish, and a description.
